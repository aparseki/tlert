[please note: this is a development version of this script. use at you own risk!]

Please note that these scripts have been superceded by the funcionality within ResIPy: https://gitlab.com/hkex/resipy I am keeping this repository open in case anyone wants to see my approach to the calculation, but I stronly recommend using the ResIPy codebase rather than ert_calculate_doi.

Not sure if all scripts are needed anymore...

The scripts are currently only setup for input of MPT DAS1 data that have 100% reciprocals.

Needs to have in the same directory as these scripts:
1) a folder called "R2files" that contains the R2 input files: one for the first inversion and one for each of the TL datsets
2) a "raw_data" folder that contains all raw ERT data
3) a "results" folder (can be empty to start off with)
4) a "figures" folder (can be empty to start off wtih)
5) a copy of R2.exe (http://www.es.lancs.ac.uk/people/amb/Freeware/R2/R2.htm). Currently working for R2 v3.0 and greater
6) the mesh file (see R2 documentation and scripts provided by Binley)
7) the elevation/topography file used to build the mesh

Might need other things... not designed to be a plug-and-play solution. It will take troubleshooting to set it up for your own purposes.
